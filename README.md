# CBPSO-PCA  (An R Implementation)

This implementation resulted from my studies, in my Master's degree dissertation and was based on the paper from Figueroa *et al.*: 

*Ramirez-Figueroa, J.A., Martin-Barreiro, C., Nieto-Librero, A. et al. A new principal component analysis by particle swarm optimization with an environmental application for data science. Stoch Environ Res Risk Assess (2021). https://doi.org/10.1007/s00477-020-01961-3*

Also available in pre-print in aRxiv.org : *https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10701*

This algorithm was not designed by me, I merely implemented it in **R**, in order to compare it with other similar algorithms. It is not original work of mine. 


The **functions** used to compute the **random matrices** and to compute the **loading matrices** were not writen by me, they are available in the **biplotbootGUI** package, in the **CDpca** function conde - available at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=biplotbootGUI.

The produced work was done under the supervision of the Assistant Professor Adelaide Freitas. 

I would also like to deeply thanks the authors of the paper for their time and opneness to discuss details of their paper and validate my implementation.
